In short, our project is applicable for the Payments and Integration Prize for Aave because it focuses on making GHO payments seamless by eliminating the need for users to remember or input wallet addresses. We have created a web dapp that uses Family's ConnectKit with React.js for easy user connectivity, leverages web3.js to interact with the GHO token, and integrates FaceIO's fio.js library for secure facial recognition. This innovative approach not only simplifies GHO transactions but also brings new use cases to GHO by seamlessly integrating it into online experiences!

The support we received was amazing! We used the Sepolia Ethereum Testnet for cost-free testing of our application and utilizing AAVE's Sepolia faucet to borrow ERC-20 tokens, which we collateralized for GHO, facilitating thorough testing without financial burden on our end.
